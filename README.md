# Calculator app

Submission by the team *'Gang of Four + 1'* for the SSGS course.  

## From the instructions for Lab Assignment 6:

### Requirements

- The interaction with the user takes place through the command line.  
- Upon launch, the program displays a welcome message and a list of the supported operations.  
- The user can select the desired operation from the available options (sum, sub, mul or div).  
- Based on the selected operation, the program asks for the necessary parameters to perform the operation (always two numbers).
- Once the user has entered valid parameters, the program returns the result of the operation and ends execution with a farewell message.

### Extra functionalities

- Improve the program's behavior in case of an invalid parameter (for example, display an error message and allow the user to try again instead of terminating the execution).

Added the workflow to run tests on push.
